This is a beginner level Web-application which I developed in 2017. Contributors are invited to make this project better by adding a better authentication in comparision to the original version.
You can also design a user menu with an interactive UI and connect everything together...
Any other modification will be appreciated too..


PS:
I pushed my venv to GITHUB as well, so that if you have any Problem <in future>, regarding the Python compatibility or anything like that, you can clone this environment and use. By the way, this is not a problem now <2019>
